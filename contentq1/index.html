      <p>What is Streaming?
        Streaming media is multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. Streaming refers to the delivery method of content, rather than the content itself.The term streaming refers to the continual transmission of audio and video files from a server to a client. In video streams, content is sent in a compressed form over the internet and is displayed by the viewer in real time. The media is sent in a continuous stream of data and is played as it arrives.Just like other data that sent over the Internet, audio and video data is broken down into data packets. Each packet contains a small piece of the file, and an audio or video player in the browser on the client device takes the flow of data packets and interprets them as video or audio. Video streaming also requires a high enough speed for the best performance. Less data is needed to stream lower video quality, but higher video quality, such as 1080p which features a progressive scan display -- or 4K needs faster data speeds to play smoothly. <br> <br>

        What is Live Streaming?<br><br>
        
        Live streaming technology lets you watch, create and share videos in real time, a bit like live TV. All you need to be able to live stream is an internet enabled device,like a smart phone or tablet, and a platform (such as a website or app) to live stream from.Live streaming is when the streamed video is sent over the Internet in real time, without first being recorded and stored. Today, TV broadcasts, video game streams, and social media video can all be live-streamed. Streaming devices are also important. Sure, most smart TVs and Blu-ray players can stream some services, but the interface and app selection can be frustrating. <br><br>

              By using 2 techniques in the Empathize stage of the Design Thinking Process we have found the needs of our viewers in the streaming category that we chose; the 5 whys and assumpting a beginner's mindset were the method we used. The needs of our viewers are to receive information, new knowledge, and be able to learn with us. Our viewers also want entertainment suited to their preferences but also still educational.

            <h5>2nd Step</h5>
            <p>
              We have used basic research to identify the reasons why people of different ages, statuses, beliefs, etc. watch the streams they watch. We found out that there are many more individuals than you could believe who are afraid to communicate publicly, regardless of their age, status, or beliefs. Some people are humiliated during a live interaction, some are loners by personality, and some simply want to be anonymous. Such people may find it challenging to communicate with and connect with others. Individuals are constantly looking for more convenient ways to connect with others.

            <h5>3rd Step</h5>
            <p>
              We have gathered all the research we could get and identified the goal and purpose of it. We have also identified which streaming platform to be used that is appropriate to the topic and content type.

       <span style="font-size:20pt;">What makes a stream good?</span>
<br> <br> 
      <p stlye="text-align: justify;" class="lastparagraph"> &#x2022; The characteristics of a good stream are entertaining, good streamers are always on the lookout for new possibilities to crack jokes, say something funny, and such. If you simply sit there and remain silent, waiting for the amusing moments to appear, the audience will not appear. <br> <br> 
        &#x2022; Another is consistency, consistently streaming because if you do not, the viewers that you could have had are going to go somewhere else and will forget you. <br> <br> 
        &#x2022; A good stream is honest, the streamers have reasons or motivations behind why they decided to go live. Some streamers want to attain things like growth or wealth, but such goals should be kept apart from your motives for streaming. <br> <br> 
        &#x2022; Lastly, respect, means you have the ability to deal with a variety of viewers while respectfully saying goodbye to those that do not want to collaborate with you.
